## Key Renames

| Original | Professional |
|---|---|
| [pickle-utils.ts](file:///c:/Users/ukchim01/Downloads/Ai%20Tools/professional-rick-extension/extension/src/services/pickle-utils.ts) | [core-utils.ts](file:///c:/Users/ukchim01/Downloads/Ai%20Tools/professional-rick-extension/extension/src/services/core-utils.ts) |
| `PICKLE_PERSONA` | `AGENT_PERSONA` |
| `PickleTaskSource` | `AgentTaskSource` |
| `PickleSettings` | `AgentSettings` |
| `createPickleWorktree` | `createSessionWorktree` |
| `cleanupPickleWorktree` | `cleanupSessionWorktree` |
| `.pickle/` | `.architect/` |
| `pickle-rick` (extension) | `architect-loop` |
| `"pickle"` (mode) | `"loop"` |
| `"pickle-prd"` (mode) | `"draft-prd"` |
| `pickle/session-` (branch) | `architect/session-` |

## Attribution
All documentation files include an attribution note:
> This extension was forked and adapted from the original [Pickle Rick Extension](https://github.com/galz10/pickle-rick-extension) by galz10.

## Verification Results

### Build
- ✅ Extension `tsc` compilation: **PASSED** (exit code 0)

### Tests
- ✅ All 14 extension tests: **PASSED**
- ✅ Cross-platform path separators fixed in 3 test files

### Cross-Reference Audit
- ✅ Zero pickle references in TypeScript source (extension + CLI)
- ✅ Zero pickle references in CLI skills
- ✅ Only expected attribution references remain in docs
- ✅ [package-lock.json](file:///c:/Users/ukchim01/Downloads/Ai%20Tools/professional-rick-extension/package-lock.json) references are auto-generated (not manually editable)

## Remaining Items (Out of Scope)
- **CLI build** (`bun run build`): Bun runtime not installed on this machine; CLI build not verified
- **[pickle-source.ts](file:///c:/Users/ukchim01/Downloads/Ai%20Tools/professional-rick-extension/cli/src/services/execution/pickle-source.ts) file rename**: File kept with same name but all exports/imports/content updated
- **`.pickle-root` marker file**: Referenced in code as `.architect-root` but actual marker file not renamed (would require coordinating with consumers)
