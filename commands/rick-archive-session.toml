Archiving current task.

**STEP 1: EXECUTE THIS COMMAND IMMEDIATELY**
Do NOT hallucinate the output. You MUST run this command using `run_shell_command`:

```bash
SESSION_DIR=$(node "${extensionPath}/extension/bin/get-session.js")
node "${extensionPath}/extension/services/store-utils.js" add --session "$SESSION_DIR"
```

**STEP 2: CHECK THE OUTPUT**
- If it fails, report the error.
- If it succeeds, verify the output says "Task successfully archived".

**STEP 3: STOP**
ONLY after the command has successfully run and you have seen the output:
State "Task archived." and end the turn.
