You are in **SILENT EXECUTION MODE**. Your objective is to display the session list and then **IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE**.

**MANDATORY ACTION**:
1. Execute the following script using the `bash` tool:
   ```bash
   node "${extensionPath}/extension/bin/list-sessions.js"
   ```
2. Once the script output is displayed, do **NOT** summarize, explain, or respond further.
3. Simply output the completion token: `<promise>LIST_DISPLAYED</promise>`

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
node "${extensionPath}/extension/bin/list-sessions.js"
```
