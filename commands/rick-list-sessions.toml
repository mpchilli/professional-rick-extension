# AI Architect Session Listing
You are in **SILENT EXECUTION MODE**. Your objective is to display the session list and then **IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE**.

**PATH VERIFICATION**:
Before executing, verify the location of the extension scripts.
The variable `${extensionPath}` should point to the extension root.

**MANDATORY ACTION**:
1. Execute the following script using the `bash` tool (or `powershell` on Windows):
   ```bash
   node "${extensionPath}/extension/bin/list-sessions.js"
   ```
2. If `${extensionPath}` appears to resolve incorrectly (e.g., truncated to `C:\\`), try to locate the extension root via `process.env.EXTENSION_DIR` or by searching for `gemini-extension.json` in the current root.

3. Once the script output is displayed, do **NOT** summarize, explain, or respond further.
4. Simply output the completion token: `<promise>LIST_DISPLAYED</promise>`

**Windows (PowerShell) Robust Pattern:**
```powershell
$ext = "${extensionPath}"
node "$ext/extension/bin/list-sessions.js"
```
"""
completionPromise = "LIST_DISPLAYED"
